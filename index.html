---
<div class="blurb">
	<p>With the rapid growth of technology, it has now influenced different aspects of people's lives and various industries (Calimanu, 2023). Automation and robotics are just some of the many commonly used technologies nowadays, but they will be the focus of this discussion. So, what roles do they exactly play in reshaping the workforce? </p>
	<p>Before answering those questions, let us foremost know what automation and robotics are, as they are the center of the discourse.</p>
	
	<h1>What is Automation?</h1>
	<p>Automation is the process of using any technology or machine to do human tasks or finish them faster than it usually takes for a person (Groover, 2023). Groover further mentioned that it only requires three things to work: (1) a power source, (2) feedback controls, and (3) machine programming; it requires little to no user involvement (Rouse, 2023). Thus, it generally aims to ease and modernize the usual easy-to-complicated jobs people do. </p> 

	<p>Some examples of automation cited by Groover (2023) are the following: </p>
	
	<h2>What are the advantages and disadvantages of using these technologies in the workforce?</h2>
	<p>
	 From the examples provided above, we get a glimpse into how automation and robotics have significantly improved the way humans do things. The main goal of these innovations is to improve our quality of life by streamlining processes and making jobs easier and more efficient.

		  At the same time, however, they also pose certain disadvantages which shows that they are not perfect systems.  Below are some of the pros and cons of automation and robotics.

	<h2>Advantages</h2>


	
	<button onclick="myFunction()" id="myBtn">Read more</button>
	
	<script>
	  function myFunction() {
	    var dots = document.getElementById("dots");
	    var moreText = document.getElementById("more");
	    var btnText = document.getElementById("myBtn");
	
	    if (dots.style.display === "none") {
	      dots.style.display = "inline";
	      btnText.innerHTML = "Read more";
	      moreText.style.display = "none";
	    } else {
	      dots.style.display = "none";
	      btnText.innerHTML = "Read less";
	      moreText.style.display = "inline";
	    }
	  }
	</script>
